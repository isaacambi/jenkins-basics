s per the Grafana dashboard, how many Jenkins jobs are there?


Make sure to look for the latest metrics in the dashboard. For that click on the time navigator option on the top right and then select Last 5 minutes.

Note: Close and open the Grafana again if no changes are reflecting and wait a little as sometimes changes can take few seconds to reflect.
YSTEMS ADMINISTRATION WITH JENKINS/MONITORING 

1. Jenkins server is already installed and it's running on port 8085. You can access the same using 
Jenkins button on the top bar. Login into the Jenkins server using below given credentials:

Username: admin

Password: Adm!n321


Notes:


a. You might need to restart Jenkins service after installing some plugins or after making 
some configuration changes etc. In such case please make sure Jenkins service is back up before
 you submit your solution.


b. Please make a note of Jenkins credentials given above.

2. $JENKINS_HOME variable holds the value of Jenkins home directory, which is /var/lib/jenkins
 in most of the cases but nor necessarily. This is where Jenkins stores its data like jobs, plugins, configs etc

3. Which of the following is the main configuration file of Jenkins?
solution
config.xml

4. While backing up Jenkins server, which of the following directories is the most crucial to backup?
solution
Jenkins home directory is most important to backup, since it contains all jobs, configuration, build history, plugins etc.

5. Install the ThinBackup Jenkins plugin.
solution
Login into the Jenkins server and follow the below given steps:


1. Go to Manage Jenkins.

2. Click on Plugins.

3. Under Available, search for ThinBackup plugin.

4. Select and install it.

5. After that click on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running.



6. Backup Jenkins (including plugins) under /var/lib/jenkins/jenkins_backup directory using thinBackup plugin.

sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/jenkins_backup
sudo chown -R jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/jenkins_backup

1. Go to Manage Jenkins.

2. Click on ThinBackup.

3. Go to Settings and enter /var/lib/jenkins/jenkins_backup as the Backup directory,
 tick Backup plugins archives check box and save the changes.

4. Click on Backup Now.

7. Using ThinBackup plugin, restore the Jenkins backup (including plugins) you just took in the previous question.


Make sure to restart the Jenkins service after restoring the backup.

service jenkins restart

Login into the Jenkins and follow the below given steps:

1. Go to Manage Jenkins.
2. Click on ThinBackup.
3. Click on Restore.
4. Select the latest backup available from the list, select Restore plugins and then 
click Restore (you need not to select any other options).
5. Restart Jenkins service.

service jenkins restart

JENKINS MONITORING
1. Let us now explore monitoring with Jenkins. To do this we have installed Prometheus 
and Grafana on the same machine called jenkins-server

As before, you can use the standard admin credentials to login to the Jenkins UI:
Username: admin

Password: Adm!n321


You can also access the Prometheus UI by clicking on the Prometheus button located above the terminal.

2. To setup monitoring with prometheus in Jenkins, please install the plugins mentioned below.

You need to install Prometheus metrics plugin, you can refer to the plugin documentation
 by clicking on the Prometheus Docs button located above the terminal.


Once the plugins have been downloaded, restart Jenkins.

solution
. Go to Manage Jenkins.
2. Click on Plugins.
3. Under Available, search for Prometheus metrics plugin.
4. Select it and install.
5. Once installed click on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running.

3. Which endpoint is the prometheus plugin exposed on by default?
solution

1. Go to Manage Jenkins.

2. Click on System.

3. Look into the Prometheus section.

4. The default path should be set to prometheus

the default path is prometheus

4. Navigate to the endpoint /prometheus/ and you should be able to see the output generated 
by the Prometheus plugin.

As an example, if your Jenkins URL is https://8085-port-acc228e844d64736.labs.kodekloud.com
 then you can view the metrics at the URL: https://8085-port-acc228e844d64736.labs.kodekloud.com/prometheus/

5. Navigate to the Prometheus UI and answer the below questions.

Which target(s) have been configured within the Prometheus configuration?
solution
Click on the button called Prometheus and then navigate to --> Status --> Targets and inspect the targets that are UP.
As of now, only the Prometheus target should be available.

6. Let us now add a scrape config for Jenkins. Update the prometheus configuration file
 located at /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml and add the following config under the scrape_configs section:

- job_name: 'Jenkins'
    metrics_path: /prometheus/
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8085']



Once the file is updated, restart prometheus using the below command:

service prometheus restart 
Wait for few seconds before submitting your question.


Note: Here localhost:8085 refers to our Jenkins Controller and the /prometheus/ metrics 
path is exposed by the prometheus-metrics plugin that we installed previously

 Edit /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml file

vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml




2. Under scrape_configs section add

- job_name: 'Jenkins'
    metrics_path: /prometheus/
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8085']



3. Then save the file

4. Restart Prometheus Service:

service prometheus restart

7. Now lets test out some queries in Prometheus. Go back to the Prometheus home page 
(by clicking on the Prometheus button within the UI) and execute the following query:

jenkins_job_count_value


What value you got in the output?

1. Click on the Prometheus button on the top of the terminal.

2. Enter the query under Expression

jenkins_job_count_value




3. Then click on Execute button.

4. Look for the Value of the Element.


8. How about now? We just added new jobs.


Execute the same query again and check if the value changes.

jenkins_job_count_value


Note: Close and open the Prometheus again if no changes are reflecting and wait a little as
 sometimes changes can take few seconds to reflect.

9. Let us see now, how we can use Grafana to visualise Jenkins metrics. Grafana is already
 installed and can be accessed using Grafana button on the top of the terminal.

Grafana credentials are:

UserName: admin

Password: admin


Note:Set a new password admin123 for the admin user.


First of all, let us add Prometheus datasource in Grafana. Follow below given steps for that:

-> Login into Grafana and click on Add your first datasource.

-> Then select Prometheus and enter http://localhost:9090 in the URL box.

-> Finally click on Save and test button at the bottom.

-> Click on Grafana logo to move back to the dashboard.

    Prometheus datasource added?

10. Let us create a dashboard in Grafana now to visualise the total number of Jenkins jobs.


Use same Grafana credentials to login:

UserName: admin

Password: admin123

Follow below given steps to create a dashboard in Grafana:


-> Login into Grafana and click on Create your first dashboard.

-> Then click on Add visualization and at the bottom enter jenkins_job_count_value in the Metrics browser box.

-> Make sure Prometheus is selected as the Data source.

-> On the right side under Panel options, enter Jenkins Jobs Count in Title.

-> Click on Apply button on the top right corner.

-> Finally click on the Save dashboard button (second button on the top right).

-> Enter dashboard name as Jenkins and save it.

    Jenkins dashboard created?

11. As per the Grafana dashboard, how many Jenkins jobs are there?


Make sure to look for the latest metrics in the dashboard. For that click on the time navigator 
option on the top right and then select Last 5 minutes.

Note: Close and open the Grafana again if no changes are reflecting and wait a little as sometimes 
changes can take few seconds to reflect.
